In Kyiv, I saw courage, hope &amp; determination in the eyes of Ukrainians. Belief in freedom, in democracy, in the rule of law.

@Europarl_EN will not waiver in our support. We will not leave you alone.

Europe will continue to #StandWithUkraine.

A batch of these MRAPs was donated to the Ukrainian army by Britain with the first vehicles delivered in June. https://t.co/wBLPTZNC8M #Ukraine: A Russian MT-LB armored personnel carrier with a ZU-23-2 23mm autocannon was destroyed by a T-64BM tank of the Ukrainian 22nd Separate Motorized Infantry Battalion used in the indirect fire role. https://t.co/qqioT9KO7A #Ukraine: A rare beast in the wild - Ukrainian artillerymen using a Estonian üá™üá™ D-30A 122mm howitzer on the frontline. 
At least 9 of these howitzers were transferred to Ukraine from Estonia starting from March as a part of military aid. https://t.co/q3GjklfJkh #Ukraine: We've all seen plenty of Stugna-P missile strikes, but just as common in the Ukrainian inventory is Soviet-pattern models. Here we see a collection of Bulgarian 9M111MFB-1 Faktoria ATGM recently supplied to Ukrainian forces.

As can be seen, they were made in 2017. https://t.co/bYV0i3BIYc #Ukraine: Another Russian Orlan-10 UAV was taken out by Ukrainian forces in the South today. They managed to recover a free DSLR! https://t.co/4r5ePGw2up #Ukraine: A Russian BMP-1 IFV was damaged/captured in the East, with at least one member of the crew killed.

Unfortunately it is difficult to determine if this is a new example from the footage available. https://t.co/EGRbxLWT7x #Ukraine: Two Stugna-P ATGM were used by the Ukrainian 30th Mechanized Brigade to destroy a Russian tank somewhere in the East. https://t.co/1Dg3u8h10N #Ukraine: A previously unseen destroyed Russian PTS-3 tracked amphibious transport in the vicinity of Chuhuiv, #Kharkiv Oblast. https://t.co/hDOXIdL2S3 #Ukraine: The Ukrainian forces received the most modern variant of the famous üá∫üá∏ Browning .50 - M2A1. The first examples were transferred to the US Army in 2011. 
The M2A1 is a modernization of a M2 with a quick change barrel which doesn't require adjusting headspace and timing. https://t.co/HrN4yEwgcF"
