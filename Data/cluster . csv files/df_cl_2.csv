At least 9 of these howitzers were transferred to Ukraine from Estonia starting from March as a part of military aid. https://t.co/q3GjklfJkh #Ukraine: We've all seen plenty of Stugna-P missile strikes, but just as common in the Ukrainian inventory is Soviet-pattern models.

As can be seen, they were made in 2017. https://t.co/bYV0i3BIYc #Ukraine: Another Russian Orlan-10 UAV was taken out by Ukrainian forces in the South today.
