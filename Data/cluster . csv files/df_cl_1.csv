https://t.co/FeUFYEwJhM https://t.co/IbtHSz3g93 His rationality was such that he understood the war was not only against Ukraine, but against civilization and all the basic standards it provides to the people: democracy, free speech, freedom, rule of law and so on.🌻

https://t.co/FeUFYEwJhM https://t.co/AuqRx9unnZ Three years passed since he sworn in as the 6th President of Ukraine. One can say he looks tired and lived 10 years. Since March, however, he certainly lived the equivalent of several lives in terms of experience.🌻
