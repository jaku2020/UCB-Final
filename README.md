Ukrainian War Tweets Sentiment Analysis and User Prediction if Human or Bot

This project originally was going to explore sentiment for AI on twitter platform. I was going to download a large sample of tweets. Unfortunately new rules on Twitter platform make it extremely challenging to accomplish it and instead I decided to use a dataset of Tweets on Ukrainian war.
The dataset is from Kaggle and is located here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bwandowando/ukraine-russian-crisis-twitter-dataset-1-2-m-rows?resource=download. It contains almost 48,000 tweets collected in one day in August last year.  It is worth keeping in mind that the tweets were in many languages. I chose to concentrate on English tweets and therefore the data decreased to a little bit over 23,000 tweets.

There are 2 Jupyter notebooks: 
* Sentiment analysis 05.22.ipynb  that explores a sentiment analysis of the Ukraine war along with the sentiment prediction algorithm. 
* Human or bot 05.22.ipynb that I used to design an ML model for predicting if the twitter user was a human or a bot and then I proceeded to explore a sentiment analysis of the Ukraine war along with the sentiment prediction algorithm for a dataset that contains only 'human' tweets.

Results are listed in 2 reports:
* Report for UCB Certificate.pdf that describes processes, results and comparisons.
* Report for client.pdf that shows the results for a prospective client
